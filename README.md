This is my first frontend development project. In this project I tried to build a modern restaurant homepage which is fully responsive. All code belongs to me and created by my own efforts.  <br>
# IMPORTANT  <br>
This website was built on the youtube channel JavascriptMastery as well however I DID NOT COPY PASTE HIS CODE AND THE WHOLE WEBSITE CODED BY ME. The only reason of me coding a website that has been coded on a youtube chanel before is because I couldn't find a suitable and cheap website design to built so i did use this channels video as ONLY A DESIGN REFERENCE so don't think that I copy paste some code from youtube to built my portfolio.   <br>
